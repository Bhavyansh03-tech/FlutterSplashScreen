# Flutter Splash Screen Demo

This project demonstrates how to implement a splash screen using **Flutter** with Lottie animations. The splash screen transitions to the home screen after a 4-second delay.

## Features

- **Animated Splash Screen**: Uses the `animated_splash_screen` package to add a smooth transition from the splash screen to the home screen.
- **Lottie Animations**: Leverages Lottie animations to display a custom splash screen animation.
- **Material 3 Design**: The project uses Flutter's Material 3 design principles for the UI.
- **Home Screen**: A simple home screen with a centered text message.
